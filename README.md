## Instructions  
 
1. Open **index.html** file.   
2. While scrolling your active section and your active link are highlighted.  
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the  appropriate section.

## Usability  

- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.  
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty `ul` and   dynamically build navigation using `Append`, `appendChild`, and `innerHTML`.    
- Styling has been added for active states.
